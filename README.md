Recipe Manager apps simplify recipe organization, offering customizable meal planning options and the ability to explore new dishes by category. While they can save time and reduce waste, there may be challenges like subscription fees and usability issues. Nonetheless, they prove valuable for cooking enthusiasts seeking to enhance their culinary expertise.

## Technologies and Tools Used:
The project utilized Trello for management, Eclipse for Java implementation, Java FX and Scenebuilder for the frontend, Teams and WhatsApp for communication, Google Docs for documentation, and GitHub for collaboration and version control.

## Conclusions and Future Work:
The Recipe Manager app simplifies recipe management and accessibility, offering customizable meal planning options and features like setting food preferences and saving custom recipes. Future improvements could include sharing features, grocery list generation, integration with smart devices, interactive tutorials, and support for importing and exporting recipes in various formats.
