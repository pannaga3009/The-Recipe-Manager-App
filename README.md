# The-Recipe-Manager-App
"Recipe Manager" application, which allows users to store and manage their favorite recipes.

## Problem Description:
The Recipe Manager App addresses the inefficiency and lack of organization in managing favorite recipes due to the overwhelming number available online and in cookbooks. It aims to provide a centralized platform for storing and organizing recipes, alleviating confusion and frustration for cooking enthusiasts. Key features include search functionality, categorization, and meal planning.

## JavaFx through Scene Builder:
The frontend of the application was developed using Scene Builder, facilitating the creation of an intuitive user interface. The Home page serves as the central point, offering features like recipe discovery, category-based filtering, saved recipes management, and meal planning. Scene Builder ensured consistency and visual appeal throughout the application.

## Java Code – Backend:
The backend logic comprises about 31 Java classes implementing concepts like ArrayLists, HashMaps, Queues, and inheritance. Classes like MainController, Login, Register, MyProfile, and MealPlan manage various functionalities such as authentication, registration, user preferences, and meal planning.

## Evaluation:
The application encompasses essential pages like Onboarding, Register, Login, and HomePage, each serving distinct purposes. Features like Discover Recipes, Saved Recipes, Categories, Search, Recipe Details, and Meal Plan enhance user experience and streamline recipe management.

## Discussion (Reflection):
Recipe Manager apps simplify recipe organization, offering customizable meal planning options and the ability to explore new dishes by category. While they can save time and reduce waste, there may be challenges like subscription fees and usability issues. Nonetheless, they prove valuable for cooking enthusiasts seeking to enhance their culinary expertise.

## Technologies and Tools Used:
The project utilized Trello for management, Eclipse for Java implementation, Java FX and Scenebuilder for the frontend, Teams and WhatsApp for communication, Google Docs for documentation, and GitHub for collaboration and version control.

## Conclusions and Future Work:
The Recipe Manager app simplifies recipe management and accessibility, offering customizable meal planning options and features like setting food preferences and saving custom recipes. Future improvements could include sharing features, grocery list generation, integration with smart devices, interactive tutorials, and support for importing and exporting recipes in various formats.
